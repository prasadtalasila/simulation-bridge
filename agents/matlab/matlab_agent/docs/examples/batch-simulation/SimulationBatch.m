    Description: Calculates the future position of a ball based on its initial position, velocity, and time.
    Parameters:
        - x_i: Initial x-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
        - y_i: Initial y-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
        - z_i: Initial z-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
        - v_x: Velocity of the ball along the x-axis (numeric).
        - v_y: Velocity of the ball along the y-axis (numeric).
        - v_z: Velocity of the ball along the z-axis (numeric).
        - t: Time duration for which the ball moves (numeric).
    Returns:
        - x_f: Final x-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
        - y_f: Final y-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
        - z_f: Final z-coordinate of the ball (numeric).
